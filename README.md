This small project is a simulation of [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).

## Usage
Simply download the repository and run the following:
```
$ make
$ ./langton
```
The program will prompt you for the inputs needed to run the simulation.

Sample inputs to generate an interesting simulation are:
* length: 100
* width: 100
* row: 50
* col: 50
* direction: 4 (i.e. WEST)
* iterations: 11000
